## Abstract <a name="Abstract"></a>

Reinforcement Learning involves learning a task through feedback based on its performance and can be expanded to include multiple measures of performance, requiring Multi-Objective Optimization. We seek to find a novel multi-objective optimization method for use in reinforcement learning. Current methods involve linear combinations of reward terms, but balancing their weights has been difficult. Instead, we plan to use Filter Methods as an alternative method of multi-objective optimization. We will test our filter method on OpenAI's MuJoCo Gym and compare our results to those using linear combination for multi-objective optimization. We will also examine alternative methods of feature selection, such as genetic algorithms. Finally, we hope to show generality and demonstrate real-world benefits by applying our work to other datasets.

#### Problem Statement

We seek to find a novel multi-objective optimization method for use in reinforcement learning.

#### Current Solutions

Current methods for multi-objective optimization involve linear combinations of the reward terms; however, balancing each of the rewards has proven difficult.
OpenAI.com has suggested that Filter Methods may be useful for multi-objective optimization and have been studied very little in relation to Reinforcement Learning.
In addition, there are many other search or optimization methods which could be derived from other subfields of Artificial Intelligence that have yet to be explored.

#### Our Approach

Our plan is to explore the use of filter methods for multi-objective optimization and reinforcement learning.
In addition, we will explore other areas of AI, particularly Genetic Programming, to find new methods of feature selection.
Next, we hope to test both of these using the publicly available <a href="https://gym.openai.com/envs#mujoco">OpenAI Gym MuJoCo environments</a>.
Finally, we hope to explore applications to other datasets that would demonstrate real-world benefits, as time permits.
