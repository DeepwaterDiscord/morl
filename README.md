## Background
Reinforcement learning often involves having a machine "learn" multiple tasks, generally requiring rewards for each task. This is formulated as multi-objective optimization.

## Problem Statement

We seek to find a novel multi-objective optimization method for use in reinforcement learning.

## Current Solutions

Current methods for multi-objective optimization involve linear combinations of the reward terms; however, balancing each of the rewards has proven difficult.

OpenAI.com has suggested that Filter Methods may be useful for multi-objective optimization and have been studied very little in relation to Reinforcement Learning.

In addition, there are many other search or optimization methods which could be derived from other subfields of Artificial Intelligence that have yet to be explored.

## Our Approach

Our plan is to explore the use of filter methods for multi-objective optimization and reinforcement learning.

In addition, we will explore other areas of AI, particularly Genetic Programming, to find new methods of feature selection.

Next, we hope to test both of these using the publicly available <a href="https://gym.openai.com/envs#mujoco">OpenAI Gym MuJoCo environments</a>.

Finally, we hope to explore applications to other datasets that would demonstrate real-world benefits, as time permits.
